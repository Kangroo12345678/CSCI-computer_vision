## Some intuitive concepts before going into specifics

## This section of notes are mainly focused on supervised learning setting

- {x__i} --> (t__i) << {C__k}
- the new notion of regression {y__i}

### Learning pipelines
- Traditional vision pipelines
- Classic machine learning pipelines
- Deep learning pipelines
  - So the differences here are 'hand-crafted features' -- 'learned features', 'hand-crafted algorithms' -- 'machine learning'

- Making sense of: 
  - what is a handcrafted algorithm
